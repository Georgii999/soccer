                        <details>
                            <summary> When soccer appears in the US </summary>
                            <p>Soccer in the United States has a varied history. Research indicates that the modern game entered the country during the 1850s with New Orleans' Scottish, Irish, German and Italian immigrants. Some of the first organized games, using modern English rules, were played in that city. 
                                The Oneida Football Club was established in 1862 by Gerrit Smith "Gat" Miller, a graduate of the Latin School of Epes Sargent Dixwell (a private college-preparatory school in Boston).[3] There were no formal rules for football games, and different schools (and areas) had their own variations. This informal style of play was often chaotic and violent, and Miller was a star while attending Dixwell. He tired of the disorganized games, however, and organized other recent preparatory-school graduates in the first organized football team in the United States.

The team consisted of a group of Boston secondary-school students from relatively elite public (state) schools in the area, such as Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston. Organization served the club well, and it reportedly never lost a game or allowed a goal.

Football at universities
Old newspaper story
"The Foot-Ball Match" chronicled the first collegiate game between Rutgers and Princeton in The Targum, November 1869.
The 1869 Princeton vs. Rutgers football game is often cited as the birth of intercollegiate American football and soccer in the United States,[a] and was played with rules based on the Football Association's (FA) first set of rules. Although American football began to take hold at eastern universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, "socker" became popular at Haverford, Columbia, Cornell, and Penn;[2]: 24  enthusiasts arranged for English teams to tour the United States to generate interest in the sport in 1905, 1907, and 1909. However, American football became the primary sport at most schools.[2]: 25–26 

The earliest known organized soccer game in the United States was played on October 11, 1866, in Waukesha, Wisconsin, under the 1863 London Football Association laws between Carroll College and Waukesha Town. Carroll won 5–2, and each goal was referred to as "game". [4]

MATCH GAME AT FOOT BALL – There was a match game at foot-ball played between the students of Carroll College and the young men of Waukesha, on Thursday last. The challenge was given by the College boys. The others had the first phase of direction in which to kick but this was changed every time. Seven games were played, of which the college boys won five. The players on the College side numbered 22, on the other side 25 (and were altogether larger men.) The whole game was well contested, and lasted nearly and [sic] hour and a half. The young men of Waukesha have challenged the College boys to play them next Thursday at 3 P.M. on the Fair Grounds, and the challenge has been accepted.[4]

Immigrant communities
Soccer was popular in communities with large immigrant populations. The West Hudson, New Jersey towns of Kearny and Paterson had textile factories established and staffed by British companies, and residents founded the National Association Football League in 1895.[2]: 27–28 

The Fall River, Massachusetts region also had textile companies and many immigrants from England. Its Bristol County League played in 1886 and the Southern New England League played in 1914.[2]: 28 

In St. Louis, the Catholic Church introduced soccer into its recreational programs. The St. Louis League was founded in 1886, and modified the FA's rules; so did the St. Louis Soccer League, which was founded in 1903.[2]: 28–29  Other cities where soccer was popular were Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.[2]: 30 

Attempts at a governing body
Formal team photo with two trophies and a game ball
The Fall River Rovers (shown in 1917) were among the few clubs to win the National Challenge Cup and the American Cup.
Before the creation of the United States Soccer Federation, soccer in the U.S. was organized at the regional level with no governing body. The country's first non-league organizing body was the American Football Association (AFA), which was founded in 1884. The AFA sought to standardize rules for teams competing in northern New Jersey and southern New York. Within two years, the AFA broadened to include teams in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.[5]

The American League of Professional Foot Ball (ALPFB) was established by the owners of several Major League Baseball teams in 1894 to generate revenue during the winter months, when their ballparks were empty. The AFA, displeased with the idea, banned any player who signed a contract with an ALPFB team. The ALPFB failed to generate much interest despite their financial backing, and the league folded after only 17 days.[2]: 31–32 

USFA vs. AFA; FIFA membership
Within a year of its founding, the AFA organized the American Cup: the first non-league cup in U.S. soccer history. Clubs from New Jersey and Massachusetts dominated its first twelve years. Due to economic conditions and labor unrest, however, teams in the Fall River area (many of whom were sponsored by textile companies) were forced to withdraw in 1894; players who had signed with ALPFB teams were also banned. The AFA suspended the American Cup in 1899; it did not resume until 1906, resulting from interest generated by an English tour the previous year.[6]: 31 [2]: 31–32 

In October 1911, the American Amateur Football Association (AAFA) was founded. The association quickly spread beyond the Northeast, and created the short-lived (two years) American Amateur Football Association Cup in 1912.

The AFA and AAFA applied for membership in FIFA, soccer's international governing body, in 1912. Drawing on its position as the older organization and the status of the American Cup, the AFA contendeded that it should be the nationally-recognized body. FIFA refused to recognize either group, ruling that only one organization could represent the United States.[2]: 33 

In 1913, several AFA organizations moved to the AAFA. The AAFA reorganized as the United States Football Association (USFA) on April 5, 1913, and FIFA quickly granted it provisional membership; the National Challenge Cup was established that fall. That cup quickly grew, overshadowing the American Cup; however, both cups were played simultaneously for the next decade. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of several associations from its cup in 1917, and the USFA created the National Amateur Cup in 1924. The last American Cup season was 1924.

Soccer wars

Near the end of the 1920s, "American Soccer Wars" began: internal conflicts within the American Soccer League and their affiliated clubs participating in the National Challenge Cup. The debate, revolving around whether the United States Football Association or the American Soccer League was the chief organization of American soccer, negatively impacted the sport's reputation and popularity. The ASL collapsed, and the first golden age of American soccer ended.[7]

The initial issue with the ASL had been the scheduling of the National Challenge Cup, which had been burdensome for the ASL season schedule. The cup had typically been played during the ASL off-season, making it difficult for ASL clubs to participate; the ASL boycotted the 1925 Challenge Cup, ostensibly due to scheduling conflicts and lack of cooperation by the USFA. According to American soccer historians, however, the real issue was the ASL's desire to be the premier soccer body in the United States.[7]

In 1927, the conflict intensified as ASL clubs were accused by FIFA of signing European players who were under contract to European clubs. Due to the conflict and apparent ASL corruption, USFA president Andrew M. Brown traveled to Helsinki for the 1927 FIFA Congress in the hope of removing penalties imposed on the ASL and USFA.[7] ASL owners wanted to run their soccer clubs like major-league baseball teams (since many of them owned both), and saw FIFA rulings and the National Challenge Cup as restrictive.[8]

Hoping to break away from the National Challenge Cup, New York Nationals owner Charles Stoneham[7] proposed that the ASL create its own championship tournament to determine the top American soccer club (an early form of playoffs ending a regular season. Stoneham also proposed expanding into the Midwest to include clubs in the Ohio Valley and St. Louis regions, creating a new division for those clubs. His plan involved having the two divisions compete in a regular season, and the top clubs in each division playing in the ASL championship tournament. Before Stoneham's proposal, the National Challenge Cup was seen as the ultimate title in American soccer; most professional leagues were regional, not national.[7]

The American Soccer League, however, operated under a closed-league model with a fixed number of franchises.[8] Unlike the National Challenge Cup, which was open to any USFA-affiliated team, the new tournament (or playoffs) would permanently cap the number of participating clubs. Three teams (Bethlehem Steel, the New York Giants S.C. and the Newark Skeeters) rejected the proposal, played in the 1928 National Challenge Cup,[9] were suspended from the league and fined $1,000.[7][8] The USFA then suspended the ASL, beginning the "Soccer Wars".[10][11] Bethlehem Steel, the Giants and the Skeeters did not play in the 1928–29 American Soccer League, joining local semi-professional leagues which were combining to form the Eastern Professional Soccer League.[10]

Support for the USFA from other national federations and the ASL's financial disadvantage as an unsanctioned league eventually convinced the latter that it could not win the "soccer war", and the dispute was settled in early October 1929.[7] The ASL had already begun its 1929–30 season, which was suspended during the settlement;[10] reassembled, it played the rest of the season as the Atlantic Coast League.[12]

Great Depression and World War II

Two weeks after the United States Football Association and American Soccer League settlement, the stock market crashed. The Great Depression drastically affected the spring 1930 ASL season; several clubs defaulted, and the clubs played an unequal number of matches. The ASL's struggles did not initially affect its stronger clubs, and the Fall River F.C. completed the double by winning the 1930 season championship and the National Challenge Cup.[13]

As the Depression intensified, the ASL folded after the fall 1932 season (its 15th). Several surviving clubs revived the ASL the following year, but the league could not field teams with the financial means or interest in attracting foreign players. The National Challenge Cup became obscurity.[14]

Despite the decline in soccer's overall popularity, it was still played by ethnic groups and expatriates in several parts of the country (primarily New England and the heartland and the New York City and St. Louis metropolitan areas). Most clubs participating in the Challenge Cup during the late Depression and World War II years were top amateur teams or semi-professional clubs, who hosted a handful of international matches.

Second professional age
Rise of the original NASL
In 1967, two professional soccer leagues began in the United States: the FIFA-sanctioned United Soccer Association (which consisted of European and South American teams which were brought to the U.S. and given local names) and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The NPSL had a national television contract in the U.S. with CBS television network, but the match ratings were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the agreement was canceled. The leagues merged in 1968 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL), which lasted until 1984.

Pele and the New York Cosmos

The most successful club in the league was the New York Cosmos, who attracted over 40,000 fans per game at their height with ageing superstars Pelé (Brazil) and Franz Beckenbauer (Germany). Past their prime by the time they joined the NASL, Pelé was considered the world's best forward and Beckenbauer the best defender. The 73,000-plus-seat Giants Stadium sold out for their 1978 championship victory.

Decline and collapse of the NASL
Over-expansion was an important factor in the NASL's demise. New franchises were awarded quickly; the league doubled in size in a few years, peaking at 24 teams. Many new owners were unfamiliar with soccer, and got out as fast as they came in when they thought that the sport's popularity was beginning to decline. Over-payment for ageing stars in an effort to match the Cosmos' success led to large financial losses. FIFA decided to award the 1986 World Cup to Mexico after Colombia withdrew, disappointing the U.S. When only the Minnesota Strikers and Toronto Blizzard were interested in playing, the NASL suspended operations on March 28, 1985.

The U.S. finished third in the 1930 World Cup, defeating Belgium 3–0 at Estadio Gran Parque Central in Montevideo, Uruguay. The match was played simultaneously with another match across town at Estadio Pocitos, where France defeated Mexico.

In the next match, the United States defeated Paraguay 3–0. For many years, FIFA credited Bert Patenaude with the first and third goals and his teammate Tom Florie with the second.[15] Other sources said that the second goal was scored by Patenaude[16][17] or by Paraguay's Ramon Gonzales.[18] In November 2006, FIFA announced that it had accepted evidence from "various historians and football fans" that Patenaude scored all three goals and was the first person to score a hat trick in a World Cup match.[19]

After reaching the semifinals with two wins, the American side lost 6–1 to Argentina. Using the overall tournament records, FIFA credited the U.S. with a third-place finish (ahead of fellow semi-finalist Yugoslavia).[20] The finish is the team's best World Cup result, and is the highest finish of any team outside CONMEBOL and UEFA (the South American and European confederations, respectively).

FIFA said that a tournament at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics would not be popular in the United States, and it would not be cost-effective to host such a tournament in hard economic times. The Olympic tournament was reinstated in 1936.

1970s–1990s
After the enthusiasm caused by the creation and rise of the North American Soccer League during the 1970s, it was hoped that the U.S. men's national team would soon become a powerful force in world soccer. Such hopes were not realized, however.

From 1981 to 1983, only two international matches were played. To provide a more stable national-team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the league for the 1983 season as Team America. The team lacked the continuity and regular training of conventional clubs, and many players were unwilling to play for the team instead of their own clubs. Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league, and U.S Soccer withdrew the team from the NASL.

The organization then targeted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1986 World Cup to rebuild the national team and its fan base. The International Olympic Committee ruled that teams outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals; the amateur-only rule had favored socialist countries from Eastern Europe, whose players were de facto professionals. The U.S. did well at the Olympics, beating Costa Rica, tying Egypt, and losing only to favorite Italy. With a 1–1–1 record, the team did not advance to the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebreaker; both countries had three points.

By the end of 1984, the NASL had folded and no senior outdoor soccer league was operating in the United States.[21] Many top American players, including John Kerr, Paul Caligiuri, Eric Eichmann, and Bruce Murray, moved overseas (primarily to Europe).

The United States bid to host the 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew due to economic concerns. Mexico was chosen over the U.S. and Canada to host the tournament, despite concerns that it would have to be moved again because a major earthquake struck Mexico shortly before the tournament.

In the last game of the qualifying tournament, the U.S. needed to draw against Costa Rica (whom it had defeated 3–0 in the Olympics the year before) to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game at El Camino College in Torrance, California (an area with many Costa Rican expatriates), and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community; Costa Rican folk dances were the halftime entertainment.[22] A 35th-minute goal by Evaristo Coronado won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.

U.S. Soccer tried to re-implement its national-team-as-club concept in 1988, offering contracts to national-team players to build an international team with a club ethos. Players were loaned out to their club teams, saving U.S. Soccer the expense of their salaries. This brought many key veterans back to the team; the NASL's success a decade earlier had created an influx of talent from burgeoning grass-roots-level clubs and youth programs. U.S. Soccer wanted to establish a more stable foundation for the 1990 World Cup than had existed in the past.

Bruce Arena failed to maintain his 2002 success at the 2006 World Cup and was replaced by national-team assistant and Chivas USA manager Bob Bradley, whose tenure began with four wins and one draw in friendlies leading up to the 2007 Gold Cup (hosted by the United States). The U.S. won all three of its group-stage matches against Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and El Salvador. After a 2–1 win over Panama in the quarterfinals, the country defeated Canada 2–1 in the semifinals. The U.S. came from behind in the final to defeat Mexico, 2–1.[23]

The team's disappointing 2007 Copa América campaign ended after three defeats in the group stage to Argentina, Paraguay, and Colombia. The decision by U.S. Soccer to field what was considered a second-tier team was questioned by fans and the media.[24]

A hallmark of Bradley's tenure as national-team manager was his willingness to cap a large number of players, many for the first time. The practice was praised by advocates of a more diverse player pool, and criticized by those hoping for more consistency and leadership from core players.[25] Young American players such as Freddy Adu, Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, Maurice Edu, Brad Guzan, Eddie Johnson and Michael Parkhurst moved from MLS to European clubs, gaining experience at the highest levels of club and international soccer.

In the summer of 2009, the U.S. was drawn into Group B with Brazil, Egypt, and Italy in the Confederations Cup. After losing 3–1 to Italy and 3–0 to Brazil, the U.S. rallied to finish second in the group and reach the semi-final on the second tie-breaker (goals scored); on the final day of group play, they defeated Egypt 3–0 and Brazil won 3–0 against Italy.[26]

In the semifinals, the U.S. defeated Spain 2–0;[27] Spain topped the FIFA World Rankings, and was on a record run of 35 undefeated games (a record shared with Brazil) and 15 consecutive wins. The U.S. advanced to its first final in a men's FIFA tournament before losing 3–2 to Brazil, after leading 2–0 at half-time.[28]

A few days after the Confederations Cup final, the U.S. hosted the CONCACAF Gold Cup and was drawn into Group B with Grenada, Haiti, and Honduras. Since the country had just played in the Confederations Cup and still had half of its World Cup qualifying campaign to go, Bradley chose a side consisting primarily of reserves who had never played together on the international stage and was criticized for doing so.[29] The U.S. began group play with a pair of victories over Grenada and Honduras, and won the group with a draw against Haiti.

The U.S. defeated Panama, 2–1, after extra time in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they faced Honduras for the second time in the tournament and the third time in less than two months. The U.S. defeated Honduras 2–0 and advanced to its third consecutive Gold Cup final, where the team faced Mexico in a rematch of the 2007 Gold Cup final. The U.S. lost 5–0 in its first home loss to Mexico since 1999, breaking its 58-match unbeaten streak against CONCACAF opponents in the country.

The team qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup atop their group, and was drawn into Group C with England, Slovenia, and Algeria. Despite an early goal by Steven Gerrard, the U.S. drew 1–1 with England in its first match after a save by Rob Green off Clint Dempsey bounced off Green's hands and rolled into the goal. The team was down 2–0 against Slovenia before tying the game, 2–2. In its third (and final) group stage-game against Algeria, Landon Donovan scored in the 91st minute to win the game – and the group – 1–0. The U.S. then played Ghana, losing 2–1 in extra time, and were eliminated from the tournament.

In the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, the U.S. led Mexico 2–0 at halftime before losing 3–2. After the defeat, Bradley was replaced by former Bayern Munich and Germany manager Jürgen Klinsmann. The team defeated Mexico 1–0 in the Azteca Stadium in 2012 for the first time and defeated world-number-three Italy in Italy, the first away victory against a top-four opponent. The U.S. topped its group of four in the second stage of CONCACAF World Cup qualification, and Jamaica was second.

The team defeated Costa Rica 1–0 in a Denver match known as the Show Clasico before drawing against Mexico in Azteca for its second qualification point in that country. The U.S. defeated Germany 4–2 in the Centennial Match,[clarification needed] and Jamaica, Panama, and Honduras to take a commanding lead of the Hex. In the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the United States fielded a younger team of players who were attempting to win their way onto the senior squad (including Landon Donovan, who was returning from a sabbatical). The team was undefeated, defeating Panama 1–0 in the final. The U.S. then defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina before losing to Belgium and ending a 13-game winning streak. The team lost to Costa Rica before defeating Mexico 2–0 in the Hex to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Klinsmann received a four-year contract extension.

The U.S. was drawn in a Group G "Group of Death" for the 2014 World Cup with Germany, Portugal, and Ghana. The team defeated Ghana 2–1 with an 89th-minute John Brooks header before drawing 2–2 against Portugal in extra time. The U.S. lost to Germany and lost 1–0, advancing from the group on goal difference, before a 2–1 extra-time defeat by Belgium in which Tim Howard set a single-match World Cup record of 16 saves.

The team finished fifth in the final round of the qualifying cycle for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, its first World Cup miss since 1986. The U.S. made the knockout rounds of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where it finished second in its group (behind England and ahead of Iran and Wales), before it was defeated 3-1 by the Netherlands in the round of 16.
